                        <Card.Text>
                            This depends on your location and the number of premises.
                            Once you complete the sign-up form, our team will be in contact to get you set up.
                        </Card.Text>

                        <Card.Text>
                            Just a tablet â€” which we can provide if you don't already have one.
                            Launch the Bolt Food app on your device and your team can start accepting,
                            managing and tracking food delivery orders in real-time.

                        <Card.Title>How much does it cost to sign up with Kitchly Kitchen</Card.Title>
                        <Card.Text>
                            There's no joining fee. If you need us to supply a tablet,
                            there will be some extra cost. In this case,
                            a small fee will be deducted from each food order until the total amount is paid off.
                        </Card.Text>


                        <Card.Title>What about the commission fee?</Card.Title>
                        <Card.Text>
                            Each order includes a small amount that helps cover the cost of delivery and other expenses.
                            This fee is calculated based on the approximate volumes of your business.
